# About The Project

This project involves controlling a car using UART communication and an ultrasonic sensor with a Raspberry Pi Pico. The car can move in all directions and stop based on commands received via the UART channel over Bluetooth. Additionally, the car is equipped with a crash prevention feature using an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles in front of the robot. If the crash prevention feature is enabled and the car is about to collide with an obstacle, the robot will automatically stop. The car also has a function to measure the distance to an obstacle using the ultrasonic sensor.

### Components Used

- **Raspberry Pi Pico**
- **Bluetooth Module (UART)**
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**
- **DC Motors**
- **Motor Driver (L298N)**
- **LED Indicator**
